Overview
=============================================================
This application uses a Reflection API which calculates the stability of every class within the JAR file.
By using the Efferent and Afferent couplings of each class, the stability is calculated.
To find the dependencies of the classes, the Reflection API is used.
I used the Swing library provided to us to design the GUI.

Deployment
=============================================================
-Install java 8
-Open Eclipse
-Run program
-Select JAR file when asked 
-Select Calculate Stability
-A new window will appear with the class name, inDegree, outDegree and stability.
